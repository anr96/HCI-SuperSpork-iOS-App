# HCI-SuperSpork-iOS-App
As the team lead, my team and I developed an app, Super Spork, in a 9-week long Human Computer Interaction course. This app was created with the user's experience in mind: through focus groups, creation of personas and use cases, and UI design reviews, development was focused on UI/UX.
